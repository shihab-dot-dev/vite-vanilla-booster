## TODO :

* Add storybook as entry point, where you list down installation, jsdoc link, demo link and all getting started terms
* Keep it concised to CSR
* PRPL - pattern readiness
* lazy loading of component and scripts when needed
* adding a notification bar(web-component) when the network is slow
* adding notification bar when there the internet goes off and dull the screen so that user wont be able to interact with it
* Try to add SSR - server first render then initiate SPA - [ not in picture as of now]
* if possible add deploy script to heruko or netlify
